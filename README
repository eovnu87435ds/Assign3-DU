1. Open Hash Table implementation runs correctly for insert, delete, member.
A random list of 1000 numbers from 0-10000 were entered into the hash table.
That list was then shuffled and deleted. The output shows small operations and
printed hash tables. After that, the statistics for the small operations, as well
as the 1000 operations are shown.
Statistics on 1000 count operation:
number of inserts: 957
number of deletes: 957
number of insert probes: 46522
number of delete probes: 23167
average probes on insert: 48
average probes on delete: 24

2. Closed hash table does not run correctly. Closed hash table inserts properly,
but does not delete all values. the problem is in the member function somewhere.
The member function hashes the input value first.
In the for loop it starts with that bucket, and checks it for the input value.
The try block is necessary because an empty list(empty bucket) normally
returns an index error. this passes the error instead of breaking the program.
if it does not find it in the current bucket, it iterates the bucket
number and continues the search. the last line is a mod 10 statement to keep
the bucket search within the index of buckets.(wrap from 9 to 0)
This is tried 10 times, at which point if nothing is found, returns False.
